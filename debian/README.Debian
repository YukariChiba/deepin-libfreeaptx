libfreeaptx for Debian
---------------------

libfreeaptx is based on version 0.2.0 of libopenaptx with the intent of
continuing under a free license without the additional license restriction added to
libopenaptx 0.2.1.

libopenaptx is already orphaned in Debian [1], and pipewire doesn't support it
anymore, we need to package libfreeaptx.
